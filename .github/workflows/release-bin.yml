#Generate a github workflow that runs on every push to master
#The workflow will build the project and upload the binary to the release
#Each push to master will create a new release with a release number that starts at 1 and increments by 1
#The release number is stored in the file .github/workflows/release-number.txt
#The release number is incremented by 1 each time a new release is created
